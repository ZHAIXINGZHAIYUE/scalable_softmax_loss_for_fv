face_train_test_1.prototxt  --------------------->trained with softmax loss on webface

face_train_test_2.prototxt  --------------------->trained with scalable softmax loss on webface

face_train_test-2.prototxt  ----------------------->trained with softmax loss on cleaned msceleb dataset

face_train_test_3_1.prototxt  ----------------------->trained with scalable softmax loss on cleaned msceleb dataset


ps:
	if you want get the value of learned \alpha, you could read the trained caffemdel to text format.
